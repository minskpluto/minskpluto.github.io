            <p>y=1/x is a rational funtion. When y=1/x is undefined, x can't be 0. That's why y also can't be 0. This is because a fraction can't be 0 when a numerator doesn't equal 0. In this fraction, the numerator is 1, which proves that this fraction can't be 0. Therefore, this reason proves that y can't be equal to 0.</p>
